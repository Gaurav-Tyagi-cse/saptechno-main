            <p><b>Objective of Student Feedback System</b> The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment and full –fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements,So that their valuable data can be stored for longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. Basically the project describes how to managed for good performance and better services for clients. Introduction: Online student feedback system is the web based feedback collecting system from the students and provides the automatic generation of a feedback which is given by students. We have developed student feedback system to provide feedback in a quick and easy manner to the particular department. We have developed Student Staff Feedback System to provide feedback in an easy and quick manner to the college principal and HOD’s. So we call it as Student Staff Feedback System which delivers via the student staff interface as online system which acting as a Service Provider. So we called it a student’s feedback system which delivers via the student staff interface as online system which acting as a service provider. By using this technology we can make fast feedback about the staff by students on time to head of departments as they referred in online system. By using this technology we can give feedback in online system as fast as compare to the existing paper feedback system. This project has four kinds of users Student, Staff, HOD’s, and Principal. The student can give feedback in online system provided by college staff. The existing system carries more time to do a piece of work for this reason the online system feedback is implemented. First of staff can prepare questions & add, update these questions to the online system. After that it was viewed by the students and can give feedback about the lecturers. Students will fill online feedback using a standard form. In this project security is also maintain that is the result of feedback is only visible to authentic user</p>
            <p><b>SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION</b> In this project i implemented the system which works on the concept of online feedback from students which is the replacement of existing paper feedback system which is so complicated method for finding an average for particular subject feedback which is submitted by students. This project has four kinds of users Student, Staff, Hod’s, and Principal. In this system we have design main three forms student login form, admin login form, faculty login form. Student will login in their login form with proper id and password which is provided by admin at the time of registration. The student can give feedback in online system provided by college staff. First of staff can prepare questions and add, update these questions to the online system. After that if student want any changes in his profile then there is an option for edit such particular information of his own. Projects Skip to content Skip to content; Online Student Feedback System. Student Feedback. 3. Reports. After that the subject contains page is displayed, where the subject is located in it and as per the selection from student students continued to their feedback after this page the feedback page is displayed. This system can be developed using After that it was viewed by the students and can give feedback about the lecturers. This page contains a form which includes such questions about the teachers where it contains some simple question regarding particular subject faculty. After giving the feedback the page appeared which contains a message like you are feedback is submitted. Then after feedback is submitted there is a log out button after click on it student will successfully log out from their profile. In main page it contains some hyperlinks like contact us, frequently ask questions, and submit the queries. And contains three particular modules like student login, admin login, staff login etc. Admin will fill the information of students as well as view their feedback, add and delete student and generate the average report of that feedback.
